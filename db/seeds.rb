          I've published 5 best-selling top-rated Udemy courses, with over 5000 student enrolments so far.
          My courses are beginner-friendly code-alongs, where you get to build a complete app from ZERO.

          I created the SupeRails youtube channel about Ruby on Rails with 150+ screencasts. In my videos
          I try to explain concepts in minutes, that otherwise would have taken days or weeks to learn.
          The goal is for you to learn 10x faster than it took me!

          I write a ‚Äúdev log‚Äù blog, where I document the most interesting, most challenging daily programming
          challenges I overcome at work. I think that writing a ‚Äúdev log‚Äù and documenting learnings helps with
          structuring knowledge. It helped me become 10x dev vs who I was.

          When Hotwire was released, I worked at a startup using Rails, GraphQL and React. We were early adopters
           of Hotwire, and we completely rewrote our app into a Rails monolith with server-side rendering with Hotwire
            & ViewComponent for the design system. The frontend had complex UI interactions that were previously done with
             React, so I had the opportunity to solve complex problems with Hotwire, Kredis, ViewComponent, StimulusJS, RequestJS.
              Since then I have worked as a ‚ÄúFrontend owner‚Äù with different companies, where my role was to create complex UI's with Hotwire.
               While working with this technology, I identified multiple common-use patterns and best practices, that I want to share!

          BTW, I never got a CS degree. I am self-taught! Initially I tried out Ruby on Rails, because I needed a ‚ÄúSchool Management app‚Äù
          for my business. I did not find a good one on the market, so I decided to build one. With no prior experience, Rails was very fast
            to learn. I was amazed by scaffolds, associations, devise and Heroku - it's all I really needed to worry about when building my app!
            That's what I call Rails magic - being able to jump in and build something that provides business value with minimal experience!

        With promises of improved performance, better portability and compatibility, and fewer dependencies, 
        Shopify's Rails Infrastructure team decided to migrate our core Rails monolith from Mysql2 to Trilogy.

        In this talk, we'll explore why the Trilogy client was built and why Shopify wanted to adopt it. 
        We'll learn a bit about MySQL protocols and look at some of the missing features we implemented in 
        order to migrate Shopify to Trilogy. Finally, we'll discuss the impact of migrating on Shopify's 
        production monolith, and look at the process of upstreaming the adapter to rails/rails.

        At Shopify we have almost 300,000 Rails tests and we add 50,000 more annually. The sheer amount of tests 
        and their growth makes it impossible to run all tests, all the time! Hence we implemented a framework to 
        only run tests relevant to your code changes.

        We will build a test selection framework from scratch in this workshop. We will begin by exploring the 
          fundamentals of such a framework: code analysis. After that we will dive into minitest reporters, 
          how they work and how we can use them to generate a test map. Finally we will use the generated

      %(Rails applications can be easily enhanced with PWA (Progressive Web Applications) functionalities 
      thanks to the latest changes on the way the client-side is managed. This creates a great opportunity 
      to reach non-conventional audiences (i.e.: people that lack a stable internet connection), and generate 
      a positive impact in their lives with creative solutions.

      In this session, you will learn how to turn your regular Rails application into a PWA, 
      allowing it to provide functionality under different network conditions. Most code samples belong to 
      a case study of an application conceived for rural people living in areas lacking stable internet access, 
      such as farmers and agricultural technicians. We will cover exciting stuff such as caching and providing 
      an offline fallback, how to make your app installable, and performing offline CRUD actions with IndexedDB and Hotwire.
      
      Outline:
      
      What is a PWA and why they're great / why should I turn my Rails app into a PWA
      Step-by-step guide to set up the main pieces of software required for PWAs: how to set up service worker and 
      manifest sticking to the MVC pattern.
      How to cache key assets and pages, and provide an offline fallback.
      Outline of steps for allowing the app to perform CRUD actions and synchronization using Hotwire and IndexedDB:
      Create records, save them on indexedDB, and sync them later, either manually or automatically.
      Read and update records that have not been synced.
      Key takeaways and further opportunities.
      Expected outcomes:
      
      Basic and practical knowledge about how to turn a Rails app into a PWA using the MVC pattern and Hotwire.
      To become more aware of potential non-conventional audiences for our apps and their challenges.
      Intended audience: Software developers (all levels welcome!), front-end and back-end developers, 
      project/company leads, and product designers.

        An individual workspace's data is isolated and made invisible to others at runtime. 
        This is achieved by using logical safeguards, the most common being: query time filtering using a 
        customers's unique ID.

        Engineers are human, and most engineers are not security experts. This means that sometimes these 
        logical safeguards are implemented incorrectly or they become incorrect after a large architectural change.
        
        We have solved this problem by weaving the customer id into all inline and async work and

      %(We've always been told that the right way to style our sites is to keep presentational details out of our markup, 
        and safely encapsulate them in our stylesheets instead. But if this is the right way to build websites, why are our 
        stylesheets always the first thing to spiral out of control into an unmaintainable 800kb mess that everyone on the team 
        is afraid to change?

        In this talk, you'll learn why ‚Äúseparation of concerns‚Äù isn't the right way to think about the relationship between 
        HTML and CSS, why presentational class names lead to code that's so much easier to maintain, as well as loads of tips, 
        tricks, and best practices for getting the most out of Tailwind CSS, directly from the creator himself.

          lazy loading & more), and the code overview required to achieve these behaviours;
        - Overview of the large ecosystem of Hotwire tools (turbo streams, turbo frames, StimulusJS, kredis, RequestJS, 
          Turbo Power, Stimulus Use, Stimulus Components, Cubism & more), when to use and how to combine these tools; 
        - What are the limits of Hotwire?
        - How to write readable and maintainable Hotwire code?
        
        By the end of the talk you will have an understanding of the range of problems that Hotwire and it's ecosystem 
        can solve to deliver a seamless frontend experience.

      %(Open source is amazing - for decades, it's been the driver of tech industry creativity and growth. 
        But as long as our food, devices, and homes are not similarly open and free, this creativity needs to be 
        rewarded monetarily, too.

        Commercialized open source has effectively supported authors while also maintaining the benefits that open 
        principles have on the industry. By obtaining an adequate share of the value we create, we'll be able to work 
        on industry-changing projects we're passionate about for years to come.
        
        Yet, achieving success in this domain is not without its challenges. We must be willing to learn, experiment, 
        and overcome obstacles along the way. In this talk, I will unveil my insights on navigating this journey, 
        harnessing the power of Rails at every stage.

      %(Ruby on Rails was the hottest technology web development had ever seen. It became a staple technology for web developers. 

        But things changed.
        
        Single-page web applications and microservices became the standard. Server-rendered monoliths were out of style; 
        Rails was out of style. 
        
        The community persisted, but the excitement was missing. We put our heads down and continued to build applications 
          using the tools and technology we love. We continued doing so while people mocked Rails for being slow and dead.
        
        Eventually, the tide turned- and Rails excited developers again. Today, people are excited to build new applications 
        with Ruby on Rails.
        
        Let's celebrate the resurgence and explore how we can contribute to the movement.

        of these services through re-implementing them back inside our Rails monolith. This talk will cover the reasons 
        why these services existed in the first place, why we felt the need to move them into our monolith, whether the moves 
        back into the monolith were successful and what we learned along the way.
